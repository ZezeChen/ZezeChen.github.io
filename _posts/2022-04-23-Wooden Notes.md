Success is peace of mind that is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.

Don't measure yourself by what you've accomplished, but rather by what you should have accomplished with your abilities.

Think only of the best, to work noly for the best, and to expect only the best in yourself and others.

What is competitive greatness? It's being at your best when your best is needed. It's enjoying the challenge when things become difficult, even very difficult. True competitors know it's exhilarating to be involved in something that's very challenging. They don't fear it. They seek it. 

Skill means being able to execute all of your job, not just part of it.

I am just a common man who is true to his beliefs.

There is nothing sronger than gentleness.

Try not to be a man of success but rather try to become a man of value.

The smallest good deed is better than the best intention.

I believe that things turn out best for those who make the best of the way things turn out.

Did I make my best effort? Did I try to do all I could?

It's the perfection of the smallest details that make big things happen. Big things are accomplished only through the perfection of minor details.

The doer makes mistakes. Mistakes come from doing, but so does success. The individual who is mistake-free is also probably sitting around doing nothing. And that's a very big mistake.

There is a choice you have to make, in everything you do. And you must always keep in mind the choice you make, makes you.

If you dot have the time to do it right, when will you find the time to do it over?

The man who is afraid to risk failure seldom has to face success.

Never cease trying to be the best you canbe. That is under your control. The other isn't.

Do not become too concerned about what others may think of you. Be very concerned about what you think of yourself.

What was under my control was how I prepared myself and our team.

I will do the best I am capable of doing today to bring out my best tommorow.

If you get caught up in thigs over which you have no control, it will adversely affect those things over which you have control.

To do better in the future you have to work on the right now. Dwelling in the past prevents doing something in the present. Complaining, whining, making excuses just keeps you out of the present.

That's where self-control comes in. Sef-control keeps you in the present.

Do not permit what you cannot do to interfere with what you can do.

The more concerned we become over the things we can't control, the less we will do with the things we can control.

Always try to be the very bast that you can be. Learn from others, yes. But don't just try to be better than they are. You have no control over that. Instead try, and try very hard, to be the best that you can be. That you have control over. Maybe you'll be better than someone else and maybe you won't. That part of it will take care of itself. 

There is no substitute for hard work and careful planning.

Failing in prepare is preparing to fail.

The only person who knows if you made your best effort is you, you can fool everyone else.

I will be prepared and then perhaps my chance will come, because if it does come and I'm not ready, another chance may not come my way soon.

The time to prepare isn't after you have been given the opportunity. It's long before that opportunity arises. Once the opportunity arrives, it's too late to prepare.

Make each day your masterpiece.

You have to apply yourself each day to become a little better. By applying yourself to the task of becoming a little better each and every day over a period of time, you will become a lot better. Only  then will you be able to approach being the best you can be. It begins by trying to make each day count and knowing you can never make up for a lost day. Don't think you can make up for it by working twice as hard tomorrow. If you have it within your power to work  twice as hard, why aren't you doing it now?

There are no shortcuts. If you're working on finding a short cut, the easy way, you're not working hard enough on the fundamentals.  You may get away with it for a spell, but there is no substitute for the basics. And the first  basic is good, old-fashioned hard work.
